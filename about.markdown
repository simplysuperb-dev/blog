👋 Hi, stranger!

This blog is a place for anyone who loves coding, solving puzzles, and learning new tricks. Here, you'll find helpful tips for working with php, laravel, js, react (& react native), and easy-to-understand guides on math (mostly discrete math problems).

I create and share open source projects for the React Native and Laravel communities. Some of the projects I've worked on include:

- [react-native-pan-pinch-view](https://github.com/fakeheal/react-native-pan-pinch-view): 🔍 A view component for React Native with pinch to zoom and drag to pan functionality.
- [react-native-intl-phone-field](https://github.com/fakeheal/react-native-intl-phone-field): 🌐 React Native Text Input Component for International Phone numbers.
- [ui-kit](https://github.com/simplysuperb-dev/ui-kit): 🌬️ Web UI kit following simply superb.'s design system, based on Tailwind CSS.
- [jekyll-theme-superb](https://github.com/simplysuperb-dev/jekyll-theme-superb): 🧪 Simple, Тailwind CSS-based theme for Jekyll powered blogs.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, there's something here for everyone. Dive in to make your coding smoother and more fun. Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
