# Blog
Jekyll-powered blog that follows the development process of my apps.

## About
This is a simple jekyll powered blog where I am documenting all my thoughts, problems or things that came up during the development process of ssb.'s apps that I am creating. Topics I am covering:

- HTML / CSS
- The frustration of a backend dev with HTML & CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Design Systems
- CI/CD
- React & React Native
- The struggles of a non-native English speaker

## Theme
The theme the blog uses is created by me & available for free at:
