<strong class="text-green"><em>First... Happy New Year! ü•Çüçæ</em></strong>

Don't really want to pull the devil by the tail, but I am off to a good start this year! 

Wrote my first lines of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (a css framework I think I *might* like), published a plugin for it on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@simplysuperb/ui-kit) and bundled my first `gem`!

I also made my first Jekyll theme ever [jekyll-theme-superb](https://github.com/simplysuperb-dev/jekyll-theme-superb), that this site is wearing.

All of those things need a lot of polishing to become something <span class="text-green font-bold">actually great</span>.No words can express how amazing I feel right now, but here's a gif:
